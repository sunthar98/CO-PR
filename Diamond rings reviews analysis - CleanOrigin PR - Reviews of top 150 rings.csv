It's very sparkly and the contrasting colors on it are beautiful. The only reason I didn't give this ring 5 stars is because the ring didn't come in a ring box or anything. The presentation was a little lacking. It comes in a ziplock bag, inside of a pouch, in a little cardboard box.

We then went to local jewelry stores and did not see anything we liked and they were 2-4 times the price of this one.So we started looking online and wasn't having much success there either. So by chance I thought, I wonder if Amazon has anything? Within a few minutes we came across this one and we both immediately liked it. I was a little nervous spending that much online without seeing it in person, but I felt at least I had the backing of Amazon here.I also called the Houston Diamond District directly, which I would suggest you do also before making your purchase as they will also put you at ease and answer your questions. They shipped it FedEx with signature required so you will have to make sure you are available the day of delivery which only takes 2 days upon their receipt of the order, which may take a day or two as Amazon has to review and approve it because of the cost involved.I received the ring on the date expected and upon opening it, it was so much nicer that the picture. Even the picture I am posting doesn't do it justice. The very next day I took it to an independent appraiser who put the value of it just over twice what it cost me and received a certificate stating that which is what I used for the insurance I got for it. Once they gave me their appraisal, I then showed them the certificate that came with the ring and they told me I got a really good deal and it is a well made ring.I am completely happy with my purchase and so it my fiancé.They also have matching bands where you get get just one, or actually two to capture each side on the ring.

However, after about a month or so, one of the small diamonds fell out. She hadn’t noticed when it actually came loose and did not find the diamond. We figured we’d get the stone replaced and have a jeweler tighten all the mounts, but before we could, another diamond fell out missing. And later a third one. After just over 3 months, the ring lost 3 stones and my girlfriend no longer wears it. We contacted the company, Ross-Simons and sent them the picture attached and they said that shouldn’t have happened and to send them the Order # details, etc. Once they found out it was an Amazon Order, they didn’t help anymore and said we’d have to work through Amazon Support.Amazon support said they’d send a message to Ross-Simons and at that point Ross-Simons said that they couldn’t help since it was past Amazon’s 30 day warranty plan. They said there was nothing they could do, unless I had bought the extended warranty plan, which I hadn’t.Bottom line is… It’s a beautiful ring, but cheaply made.

It’s really a favorite ring. I wear it constantly and I’m really not the most attentive about jewelry so I usually forget to remove if washing hands or dishes. I’m truly surprised it hasn’t tarnished at all though it’s listed as plated jewelry.It has withstood almost everything but one corner stone fell out a couple months ago as I probably may have hit my hand against something without realizing so my jeweler offered to replace it (for free cause I’m a regular). However it’s cheap enough so I’ve also reordered one as a back up.The Center stone is brilliant and beautiful.For the price I’m amazed at how well it’s held out with very frequent wear.

Compared side by side, the radiant is the rectangular shape on the bottom and the 6CT cushion cut with splint shank on the top, shows the color variation, the cushion stone looks warm tinted yellow (similar to H-I color range) and the radiant stone is very white (similar to D-E color). I personally prefer the warm yellow CZ because it resembles natural diamond color more. The radiant stone is too white for my taste since CZ has higher dispersion level than diamond it sparks ""rainbow effect"" giving the white cz blue-ish hue which I don't really like. The yellow color actually cancels out some of the rainbow effects. Because of this reason I ended up returning the radiant ring and keeping the cushion ring. Nonetheless, I still give this ring a 5 star because both stones have beautiful faceting and if you love crushed ice cut diamond this is the closest you can get to the real thing. -- Note, the cushion ring I bought from the same company called RODIFFY 6CT Gorgeous Split Shank Cushion Cut Engagement Ring for Women, G-White Color,White Sapphire Simulated Diamond Ring, 18K White Gold Plated 925 Sterling Silver Promise Ring, Anniversary Ring",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51QZyGY1WJL._SY88.jpg,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61IXnrOQ-RL._SY88.jpg,,,,,,,,One person found this helpful,different color variation,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3I9SZ2D5LW2YC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C4SMHTM6,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2023",MarcMarc,

Here's my story; after years of roller coaster weight loss contributing to the multiple sizings of my original set, my jeweler finally told me that my original set was so threadbare that if it were to ever break again he would have no choice but to melt it down into a pendant. That was about 10 years ago and I haven't worn rings since. Until now. I found this set online and loved it the minute I saw it, but they didn't make it in my size. I messaged the company and asked if they could make this set in a true size 4 and they did just that! So I ordered this set as a stand-in of my original set. The rings arrived today and I'm overwhelmed at how amazing they are. They are magnificent!! They came packaged very well and were nestled in this lovely giftbox along with a nice ""Thank you"" card and a ""Limited Lifetime Warranty"" card. I do have on a small wishbone ring in some of the photos, that's not included; I just always wear that; but I wanted to note how that design goes well with this set too. The wedding band itself is rather wishbone shaped so this set will allow you to stack rings. The diamonds shine like you wouldn't believe, they're simply stunning when light hits them. The rings really are a true size 4. They fit me perfectly, not too small and not too big; they don't roll around on my fingers, etc. The design isn't overly large and yet it isn't small by any means, it is in fact the perfect size of in between. If you're unsure, get a ruler and measure the mm size of the design to see for yourself. That's the method I chose when ordering this set. These are absolutely gorgeous and the price is ridiculously amazing as well. This set really can't be beat! I'm so happy I stumbled across them and now I can finally wear my rings again. Buy them!! You won't regret it!! I would definitely consider them giftable as well, given the beautiful box they come in. They truly look way more expensive than what they are. They really are stunning!!

My engagement ring is an emerald cut & I found it hard to find a matching wedding band. So I gave up on matching and just set out to find something unique and eye catching. This Ross-Simon band fit the bill & I am sure not disappointed. I read the reviews. Some said to size down so I held my breath and ordered my usual size. My engagement ring is a 6½. I ordered a size 7 baguette band. I'm very happy with how it fits! Fits like my 6½. I would definitely recommend this ring. I included lots of pictures, because when I'm shopping online I love when people post their pictures.***Update: I've been wearing this ring for 10 months and I still love it. I have not had any issues with snagging or lose diamonds. I like to clean my rings often, and take them off when I do dishes or work with my hands a lot. I know some people want to just wear their jewelry and not have to worry about taking them off, but for me I see it as keeping my rings nicer longer.

It's comfortable to wear and isn't so heavy that it swings around your finger. It actually stays positioned so that you can see and appreciate the beauty of it.When I opened the box, attached to the ring was a little label saying ""Made in India"" and I was surprised by that because, no disrespect intended, I typically don't like jewelry or the yellow gold used in jewelry made in India. I have found the 14k gold from India to be much softer than that of the jewelry made in the USA. I re-read the description of the ring and I could not see anywhere that the ring was made in India, so I take a full star off for that.The other disappointment I had is that the ring only comes in whole sizes. Unfortunately, I needed the half size in order for it to fit on the intended finger. So, with that, I have to wear it on the opposite hand that I wanted and on a different finger than I wanted it for. I'd take a half star off for the sizing issue.The ring is not so noticeable from a distance, but when the sun or a light catches it, it does sparkle. It is beautifully set as a low profile ring and there are NO prongs sticking out to catch on towels or delicate clothing, one thing that I appreciate most in an everyday wearable ring.All in all, it is a beautiful ring, but for the reasons mentioned above, I'd rate it 3.5 stars and would definitely recommend it to others if they're looking for this style and type of ring. If it holds up and doesn't lose any of the diamond chips over time, then I'd consider this a great investment. I did not purchase the $45 insurance because that would've pushed the cost of the ring over what I wanted to spend and I can get insurance on it through my personal homeowner's insurance for far cheaper.As a side note, the ring did not come with any paperwork of authenticity as it shows in some of the other Ross Simons rings descriptions, so that was a bit of a disappointment too.",,,,,,,,,,8 people found this helpful,MADE IN INDIA.

All diamonds are very securely set. There's a significant amount of rhodium plated white gold in this hefty ring. It is sizable by a reputable jeweler; if you have it sized, rhodium plating at the shank will cost a bit more, but isn't strictly necessary. When Amazon dropped its price to a small fraction of regular retail, I placed an order. The diamonds in my ring are approximately one grade above the color and clarity listed on the web page description. Not all will be that way, but Amazon has free returns if you aren't happy.

So to give some features of this ring - it is beautiful, the stone is beautiful and well cut. The color of the stone is lighter than some of my other rings, very beautiful. I can't say this or that is better, I like how different rings have different qualities, so the very clear and light color of this stone is very much appreciated, I think it makes it look more like a diamond compared to some of my other rings that have the same description of stone but their stones aren't as pale as this one. The setting is beautiful, the sparkle is wonderful. In recognizing that it is an inexpensive base metal that has been plated, I am looking at clear coating it to keep it new and researching the options and techniques online, such as nail polish and spray enamel, which has to be done from time to time should you go this route. I have not given this ring my own layers of protection yet, but I know the gemstones should not be clearcoated, just the metal, so cover the gemstones carefully to keep any clear coat you might add off of them or your ring will probably be ruined by a clear coat material that gets on the stones. The part that touches your skin is the main focus for clear coat after market protection, and that I'll test on a ring that is less beautiful than this one before I try to give my own layer of protection to this one. If you clear coat the inner band against the skin, make sure you're not allergic to the clear coat and that it's appropriate for your ring - do your research and testing carefully, as well as your coating. Remember, clear coatings can be removed by cleaners and chemicals like if you do dishes or cleaning, swimming pool chemicals, or showering, etc (hot tubs...) so take your beautiful jewelry off before any activities that might damage it, or as soon as you realize, and carefully clean.I highly recommend this ring.

You really can’t tell the difference. This one was a bit of an upgrade with the 14k and the side stones, and I’m still free to enjoy it without worrying too much about it. I really love it.

I knew that I didn't want him to spend ridiculous amounts of money on a ring that can be better spent on other wedding related items. I also did alot of research in terms of 3 C's when it came to the stones and I went back and forth on whether to choose a moissanite or a high quality cz ring. After many days of looking at different cuts I fell in love with this one. I must admit that shipping took very long. It took a little over a month to arrive in my hands, however, the wait was worth it! I am absolutely pleased and my fiance loves it as well. The ring is very well made and super dainty which I love!

The total carat weight of the diamonds came back at 1.02 ct (Advertised at 1.35)B. The Clarity came back at SI-2. It would have been SI-1 but we were told that due to a chip in the diamond, that based on her opinion, was likely caused during setting, she had to downgrade it. (Advertised at VS2-SI1)C. The color of all stones were rated G-H (Advertised at D-F)I emailed the company about this, letting them know that since my fiancé loves the ring I am in no way asking for a refund. Their reply from a Nathan, was that the appraiser must be lying about the weight and that I should be able to see that the color of the center stone is better than the color of the side stones.I asked what motivation the independent appraiser would have to lie to us, but I have not gotten back an answer.While I'm sure it's possible that the lady from Independent Gemological Services, made a mistake of some kind, I cannot fathom a reason why she would lie on her report.

Just be aware what you're getting when ordering.However, that's not to take away from the beauty of the ring. The accent stones along the infinity band are gorgeous and added a lot of sparkle to the whole ring. And in direct lighting even the solitaire sparkles plenty.My (now) fiancée loved the ring and couldn't believe how beautiful it was or that it was exactly her style. She was more impressed with the solitaire and ""sparkling"" of the whole set than I was. But I'm glad for that.The sizing I selected came exactly as I ordered and fit her finger perfectly, something she was also impressed by.Will definitely use seller/dealer again for our next rings (wedding bands) and anniversary gifts. Very glad about their products, prices and service.Ring came with a low quality, but adequate black velvet box and a slightly cheesy computer printed diamond certification.

It is seriously prettier than some diamond rings I've seen. I have a two ct round solitaire ring that's diamond and I think I like this one more than it. Shhhh! Just don't tell my husband .

This isn't usually my style. The ct is huge. The only reason I give four stars instead of five is because it arrived scuffed on the back and I wear a five and I find it's a little too small. I can still wear it but it's hard getting on and off. I will order a six in near future. This will be my stand in and I will update as time goes on. It's real sterling silver and is stamped.

It is large, very clear stine, looks like a diamond in color meaning it does not look like a piece of glass. It has facets in it and sparkles beautifully in sun and ambient lightening. It does not turn my finger green at all. I wore it for a week everyday, doing my normal days activities and it didn't effect it one bit. The sterling seems to be very plated on most likely has a rhodium flash on it. Anything plated without rhodium on me, turns my skin green. I have very high acid in my skin. This ring is great in every way, except the band is thin for a stone that size! I've bought a stainless steel wide band to pair with it! I know it's really going to make that ring pop! I bought an etched band and a wide plain band. Suppose to be here today. I will post a picture at that time with the band. It is true to size, does not spin on my finger. I. Clean it daily in the morning with a little dish soap and a soft tooth brush, rinse in warm water then cold and I dry and polish with an old cotton tee. It looks brand new Everytime. Do not use jewelry cleaner on any of this type jewelry!! It will RUIN your ring!! And it just never requires that type of cleaning. It will take the finish off your prongs even if the rest stays nice! Once my prongs turn brass, I pitch it! So many times even if the plating is solid and possibly rhodium flashed, often times the prongs are not! And a harsh chemical such as cleaners will take the plating right off those prongs! Just stick with soapy water and dry cotton cloth, it will be beautiful a very long time. I also have noticed with this type of cz it actually gains greater luster and shine over time for some reason. I've never had one to cloud on me with proper care. These type of cz have a certain look to them that you can spot in an actual photo of the ring after you've bought a few. It looks hard, it's clear, it's faceted, it reflects light similar to a diamond. However the 4 carat size makes other family and friends know it's fake. But if your a high society gal, that wants something to wear on vacation or when going out, and you generally wear big stones...Don't hesitate buy it, pair it with a beautiful band, a silver bracelet and off you go.

I thought, heck, why not give it a try since almost everyone else seems to love it. I do not know what I had in my mind, but for $19.88 (after taxes), this ring has far exceeded my expectations. My boyfriend and I were looking for a promise ring. I did not want him spending a ton of money on rings, so I decided to look at sites like Jeulia, Jewlr, etc. and then for fun, decided to see what Amazon had. I will be honest, before I bought this, the day before I had bought a Jeulia ($93 after taxes on their site) ring, sterling silver and simulated stone solitaire and 1 ""carat"" as well....impressed but this TenFit ring is preferred by me...and it was not even 20$!!!!...I cannot get over it! This ring shines like crazy, their sizing was true to size for me, and it's not a faux looking. If I was shown this ring, I would never have guess it's a simulated diamond (cubic zirconia). I have purchased CZ rings before, from Pandora, and even after a few days, the silver lost some of it's shine and so did the CZ. It became cloudy and just looked fake. Now, I really did not care what simulated stone I got, it just so happened that this one was CZ. Great quality, great price, and looks genuine. No problems at all yet, still looks brand new. Totally worth it if you're not looking to spend an arm and a leg. I plan on doing another updated review after a couple months but so far, one very surprised and pleased customer.Update 12/22/18: ring is still holding up beautifully and no issues. I expected scratching from everyday wear being sterling silver but sterliving silver Jewry wipes do the trick to bring back that shiny look. I’m in love with it still.

This ring does not have the ""fake cz"" look at all and even at 4ct looks very believable. This ring is perfect if you want to wear your real diamonds but don't want to risk misplacing them or losing a valuable real diamond. I love wearing this ring and the fit is much like a high quality comfort fit band. I have seen some ladies on here talk about ""baking"" their CZ's to make them more diamond like and I was going to do that with this little ring until it arrived. I wouldn't even think of baking it to change it's color or shine now because it's so amazingly beautiful just the way it is. I was also very happy this ring came in smaller and half sizes because I have very long thin fingers. I got a size 4.5 and it fits like it was made just for me. No one will ever know this ring is a CZ and not a real diamond it is so spot on. I compared it with my real diamonds and they are so close! If you want a beautifully convincing looking diamond ring this is the perfect one. I couldn't take it off at all when I first received it and that was almost four months ago it was so stunning!

I bought another ring, that had a thicker band and fewer diamonds (3 or 5 I can't remember) and at least 2 of the diamonds fell out of that ring very quickly so I was very wary of how this ring would fare. I am very pleased to say that this ring has held up well. I shower with it on, wash my hands, cook, sleep, etc. All the diamonds are in tact and are as sparkly as when I bought it. It comes with some kind of certificate of authenticity which I wasn't expecting and really probably don't really care too much about because I just think the little tiny diamonds are brilliant and the low profile (due to how dainty it is) allows for my engagement ring to show (the diamonds on my engagement have an open setting on the sides). The only thing that would change about this ring is to have the diamonds go all the way around instead of just halfway because it constantly spins around so all you see is the plain side of the band.

Initially it was $197 ! I am so glad I waited until it was on sale for mother's day $147. It is beautiful and I love the hearts very much. It has a 10k inscribed inside the band and it says India... so I am guessing it's where it was made. I do have to say the quality of the diamonds is really low as it said I2 to I3. You can tell they are grainy in color. So if you're looking for top notch quality diamonds this ring is not it. I would have given it 5 stars if the diamonds were better looking.

This was the only ring I found that met all of my criteria and the price was unbeatable. I wear it daily along with my Miadora rose gold ring which matches it perfectly and I never take it off.

It feels like it is made of tin and you could've gotten it out of a quarter machine. I thought I was getting a good deal with this one, but it's clear now that you get (less than what) you pay for.UPDATE: Amazon replaced the ring even though it was past the return window.

I've used a silicone band in the past when my fingers swell and my rings don't fit. However, this is a much prettier option!I love how dainty the band is, and the cubic zirconia diamonds sparkle brilliantly (or as least as much as they can not being the real thing).

It is very sparkly and I love the detail of the additional sparkle on the sides. The band does not seem flimsy, like it would bend out of shape easily. It feel sturdy. The setting of this ring also does not catch sweaters and other delicate fabrics. It is common for my rings, particularly less expensive ones, to require extra attention and care in order to keep from ruining my clothes when I am wearing them. This has none of that.

The ring sparkles brilliantly, however, any time I move the ring or even pick it up, it jingles. Almost like stones are loose inside of it but I couldn’t figure out which stones. It was the most bizarre thing I’ve ever experienced with a ring. While it does have a cute appearance, I wouldn’t trust it for daily wear out of fear that stones would go flying out of it.This ring is incredibly light. It makes me question the metal truly being sterling silver as it was stamped stamped. I have many cubic zirconia rings made of sterling silver but none feel this light.I ordered a size five, my normal size, and it fit perfectly. I will note, it’s hard to tell the shape unless you watch the product video. This ring will not fit against a wedding band or other ring as the edges are rounded.$16 is a low price but I have concerns about how well it would hold up over time.
